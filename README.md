# CS189: Convolutional Neural Networks
## Week 8: Intro to Deep Learning
### Topic 34: Building your own CNN (Convolution + Pooling) to classify on MNIST/CIFAR-10

### Learning Objectives
This coding assignment, along with the notes and slides, serves as an introduction to convolutional neural networks. From this assignment, students are expected to learn these topics:
* How convolutions work with different types of kernels
* How convolutional neural networks work to extract features from images
* Machine learning technician skills to implement CNNs
* Intuitive introduction to adversarial inputs
* Reading and implementing an architecture directly from a research paper

### How these objectives are achived
* Students wil begin the assignment by implementing a convolution operation and learning about how different convolutions with different kernels transform images. 
* Then, they will develop an intuition for what the layers of a convolutional neural network learn during the training process based on a toy example. With this toy example, they will visualize filters from a CNN and will learn how to extract layer activations from a trained model. 
* They will then be expected to build their own model to classify on CIFAR-10 and plot the learning curve, helping them to learn machine learning technician skills while also gaining familiarity with common architectural modifications (striding, pooling, batch normalization, etc.). 
* After training their model, they will create their own adversarial inputs to cause their model to misclassify, demonstrating how a model can be susceptible to images with targeted perturbations. 
* Finally, they will also gain basic practice with reading and implementing a machine learning paper by implementing a residual block based on the ResNet paper.
